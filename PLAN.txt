Azfar: Do the tensorflow models using python

Simon: Port them to the front end using nodejs

Nabeel: Make the front end

Nabeel: connect raspberry pi to wifi network

Simon: program Nabeel's raspberry pi in nodejs

Simon will also make it so that: 
left command will push object to left to recycling and return back to initial state
right command will push object to right to trash and return back to initial state

Simon: Port that to laptop's nodejs so commands of left and right will be accessible in the browser (/command?action=left or right)

Nabeel: Update accordingly

Someone: setup the materials (motor, bins, breadboard, etc...) so that the motor will push it to either the recycling or trash
